The carrot lib is built with Java 8 by default,
so until Java 8 bytecode is supported on Android we need to build it manually:

Build it from
https://github.com/codeka/carrot
with setting these in its build.gradle:

targetCompatibility = '1.7'
sourceCompatibility = '1.7'


./gradlew jar
./gradlew javadocJar
./gradlew sourcesJar


Get the version with:
git describe --tags
